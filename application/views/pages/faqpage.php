Vaccinations protect your child against serious diseases by stimulating the immune system to create antibodies against certain bacteria or viruses.</div>

					  <div class="panel-body"><b>What diseases do vaccines protect against?</b><br>
Immunizing your baby with vaccines protects against serious diseases like measles, whooping cough, polio, meningococcal disease, tetanus, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, influenza, and more.</div>

					  <div class="panel-body"><b>I don’t know anybody who has had these diseases. Why does my baby need these vaccines?</b><br>
While a few of these diseases have virtually disappeared because of vaccination, outbreaks of measles and whooping cough still occur in the U.S. Even if some diseases do completely disappear in the U.S., they are common in other parts of the world and are just a plane ride away. If we stop vaccinating against these diseases, many more people will become infected. Vaccinating your child will keep him or her safe.</div>

					<div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse ">
					  <div class="panel-body"><b>Are there better ways to protect my baby against these diseases?</b><br>
No. Breastfeeding offers temporary immunity against some minor infections like colds, but it is not an effective means of protecting a child from the specific diseases prevented by vaccines. Likewise, vitamins won’t protect against the bacteria and viruses that cause these serious diseases. Chiropractic remedies, naturopathy, and homeopathy are totally ineffective in preventing vaccine-preventable diseases.
Some parents think that getting the “natural” disease is preferable to “artificial” vaccination, leading to a “natural” immunity. Some even arrange chickenpox “parties” to ensure their child gets infected. It’s true that for some diseases, getting infected will lead to immunity, but the price paid for natural disease can include paralysis, brain injury, liver cancer, deafness, blindness, or even death. When you consider the seriousness of these risks, vaccination is definitely the better choice.</div>

					  <div class="panel-body"><b>What if my baby has a cold or fever, or is taking antibiotics? Can he or she still get vaccinated?</b><br>
Yes. Your child can still get vaccinated if he or she has a mild illness, a low-grade fever, or is taking antibiotics. Talk with your child’s healthcare provider if you have questions.</div>

					<div id="collapse6" class="panel-collapse collapse ">
					  <div class="panel-body"><b>How many times do I need to bring my baby in for vaccinations?</b><br>
At least five visits are needed before age two, but the visits can be timed to coincide with well-child check-ups. Your baby should get the first vaccine (hepatitis B) at birth, while still in the hospital. Multiple visits during the first two years are necessary because there are 14 diseases your baby can be protected against, and most require two or more doses of vaccine for the best protection.</div>

					<div id="collapse7" class="panel-collapse collapse ">
					  <div class="panel-body"><b>Do vaccines have side effects?</b><br>
Vaccines are among the safest medicines available. Some common side effects are a sore arm or fever. There is a very small risk that a serious problems could occur after getting a vaccine. However, the potential risks from the diseases vaccines prevent are much greater than the potential risks associated with the vaccines themselves.</div>
